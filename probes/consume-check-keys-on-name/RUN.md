# How to run

    cd probes/consume-check-keys-on-name
    ../../nova.sh check src/control_consume.nv   # must PASS, or nothing else counts
    ../../nova.sh check src/via_new.nv
    ../../nova.sh check src/via_of.nv
    ../../nova.sh check src/via_make.nv
    ../../nova.sh check src/via_free_fn.nv

`check` is the verdict: `E_CONSUME_KEYWORD_MISSING` is a checker diagnostic.

## Reading the outcomes

An ERROR is the language working. A PASS on any of `via_*` is the defect, because all
four build the same `consume`-required value and bind it with plain `ro`.

| pattern | reading |
|---|---|
| all four error | no defect; something else explains the claude-limits case, and I must find it before filing anything |
| only `of` passes | the check keys on the name `of` specifically |
| `of` and `make` pass, `new` errors | the check recognises only `new` as a constructor -- the widest and worst case |
| the free function also passes | it is not about statics at all |
